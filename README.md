# Deezweb

My web application named Deez We, used to search music and listen them

## Test my webApp

When you have cloned my file, you only need to write this in your terminal or console :

NODE.JS is required : https://nodejs.org/en/

For live-server --> npm install --global live-server

For http-server --> npm install --global http-server

`live-server` or `http-server`

After in your url go to : `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

If you have a problem or code improvements, I am open to any discussion! Enjoy ! ðŸ™‚
